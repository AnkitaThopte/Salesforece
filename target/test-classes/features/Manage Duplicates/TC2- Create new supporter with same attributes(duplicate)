Feature: To Create new supporter record and verify the details
  As a Salesforce user, login to Salesforce and create new Supporter and Verify
  the details

  Scenario Outline: Create a new supporter record with the same attributes
    Given I login to Salesforce URL
    When I click on Contact dropdown
    And I click on the New Contact under Contact Page
    And I enter following details in Salutation, First Name, Last Name and Phone fields under New Contact Page:
      | First Name   | Last Name   | Salutation   | Phone   |
      | <First Name> | <Last Name> | <Salutation> | <Phone> |
    Then I verify whether the warning message "The record you're about to create looks like a duplicate. Open an existing record instead?View Duplicates" is displayed
    Examples:
      | First Name | Last Name | Salutation | Phone |
      | Joshua      | Kasees | Captain   | 934723017 |
