Feature: As a Bequest manager, I need to manage the whole bequest lifecycle

  Scenario Outline: Assign a supporter with Bequestor Status as Intender
    Given I login to Salesforce URL
    When I click on Contacts tag
    And I click on Recently Viewed dropdown Select List View
    And I select "All Contacts" from the list view
    And I type the contact "Willson" in the Search box and press Enter to view the particular contact detail
    And I click on the searched contact name
    And I scroll down to page
    And I scroll down to page
    And I click "Edit Bequestor Status" button
    And I click on Bequestor Status dropdown and select Intender as status
    And I click on Save button
    And I scroll down to page
    And I scroll down to page
    Then I verify the Bequestor Status is set for the supporter record
      | Bequestor Status |
      | <Bequestor Status> |
    Examples:
      | Bequestor Status |
      | Intender |
